- **Reference `fileNames.md`:** Always check this file when looking for code. If missing or outdated, notify the user.  
- **Simplicity First:** Always prefer the simplest solution.  
- **Avoid Duplication:** Reuse existing logic whenever possible.  
- **Environment Awareness:** Code must work in `dev`, `test`, and `prod`.  
- **Scoped Changes:** Only modify requested or clearly related areas.  
- **Function Length:** Refactor files exceeding 200–300 lines.  
- **Mock Data:** Use mock data only for tests; never for `dev` or `prod`.  
- **No Stubbing in Dev/Prod:** Do not add fake data patterns to live environments.  
- **Environment Variables:** Manage configurations via `.env` files.  
- **.env Protection:** Never overwrite `.env` files without explicit approval.  
- **Inline Comments:** Add comments for complex logic.  
- **README:** Keep `README.md` up to date with project setup instructions.  
- **Script Management:** Avoid embedding one-time scripts in the codebase.  
- **Cleanliness:** Keep files and directories well-organized.  
- **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities.  
- **Sensitive Data:** Never hardcode secrets; use secure storage.  
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages.  
- **Branching:** Follow the project’s branching strategy.  
- **Peer Review:** All changes must go through peer review before merging.  
- **Feedback Integration:** Address review feedback promptly.  
- **Tone Adaptation:** If the user expresses frustration, complains, or uses strong language, respond with a more exaggerated, humorous tone, including superlatives and mild swearing when appropriate.
